        <p class="intro">I am a doctoral candidate in the <a href="https://bit.ly/3j0MImC" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">School of English, Trinity College Dublin</a>, where I research contemporary
            Irish women’s short fiction. Currently, I am based in <a href="https://bit.ly/37Zp97v"
                target="_blank">Trinity
                Long Room Hub</a> Arts & Humanities Research Institute, and my work is funded by the <a
                href="https://bit.ly/3xUp5As" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Irish Research Council</a>. </p>
        <p>It is an exciting time to be a researcher of Irish literature, which is enjoying a
            <a href="https://bit.ly/3geKTAT" target="_blank">golden age.</a> I am particularly interested by two
            subsections of this rich
            literary field. Firstly, as has been well-documented, women writers are disproportionately well
            <a href="https://bit.ly/3y4KSoV" target="_blank">represented</a>
            in contemporary Irish writing. Winning some of the most illustrious
            <a href="https://bit.ly/3syGPjU" target="_blank">literary
            </a>
            <a href="https://bit.ly/2Xvmro8" target="_blank">prizes</a>
            in recent years, Irish women’s short fiction has been
            <a href="https://bit.ly/3z1JJA0" target="_blank">accoladed</a> both <a href="https://bit.ly/3gbXncb"
                target="_blank">nationally </a><a href="https://bit.ly/3k5jjam" target="_blank">and
            </a><a href="https://bit.ly/3z0eyox" target="_blank">internationally.</a> Secondly, the short story is one
            of the most vibrant forms of
            the contemporary moment, with the rude health of the <a href="https://bit.ly/2UubVwf" target="_blank">Irish
                publishing scene</a> and the <a href="https://bit.ly/2UwenCB" target="_blank">recent </a><a
                href="https://bit.ly/3xXP9uj" target="_blank">spate</a> of <a href="https://bit.ly/3sx0WPu"
                target="_blank">short </a><a href="https://bit.ly/3k5jxhI" target="_blank">fiction </a><a
                href="https://bit.ly/3mfgSVb" target="_blank">anthologies</a> allowing story writers to reflect on
            social conditions and the world
            around them in real time.
        </p>
        <p>I focus specifically on short fiction published in the last ten years – including collections by Lucy
            Sweeney Byrne, Claire Keegan, Nicole Flattery, Danielle McLaughlin, Claire Louise Bennett, Cathy
            Sweeney, Mary Costello, Wendy Erskine, Lucy Caldwell and June Caldwell, among others.
        </p>
        <p>Broadly, my work examines the ways that literature charts changes and transitions in the ideological
            underpinnings of contemporary society; my thesis explores literary representations of Ireland’s changing
            hegemonies, from traditionalism to modernisation and neoliberal late capitalism. As a researcher, I am
            interested in what it means to ‘write Ireland’ in a context defined by globalisation, neoliberalism, and
            a post-history outlook.
        </p>
        <p>I also hold a first-class honours degree in English Literature & History from Trinity College Dublin,
            where I was elected
            <a href="https://bit.ly/3y4Lr21" target="_blank">
                Scholar
            </a>
            in 2016. In 2019, I was awarded an MSc. with distinction from the University of Edinburgh.
