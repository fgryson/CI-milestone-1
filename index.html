        It is an exciting time to be a researcher of Irish literature, which is
        enjoying a
        <a href="https://bit.ly/3geKTAT" target="_blank">golden age.</a> I am
        particularly interested by two subsections of this rich literary field.
        Firstly, as has been well-documented, women writers are
        disproportionately well
        <a href="https://bit.ly/3y4KSoV" target="_blank">represented</a>
        in contemporary Irish writing. Winning some of the most illustrious
        <a href="https://bit.ly/3syGPjU" target="_blank">literary </a>
        <a href="https://bit.ly/2Xvmro8" target="_blank">prizes</a>
        in recent years, Irish women’s short fiction has been
        <a href="https://bit.ly/3z1JJA0" target="_blank">accoladed</a> both
        <a href="https://bit.ly/3gbXncb" target="_blank">nationally </a
        ><a href="https://bit.ly/3k5jjam" target="_blank">and </a
        ><a href="https://bit.ly/3z0eyox" target="_blank">internationally.</a>
        Secondly, the short story is one of the most vibrant forms of the
        contemporary moment, with the rude health of the
        <a href="https://bit.ly/2UubVwf" target="_blank"
          >Irish publishing scene</a
        >
        and the <a href="https://bit.ly/2UwenCB" target="_blank">recent </a
        ><a href="https://bit.ly/3xXP9uj" target="_blank">spate</a> of
        <a href="https://bit.ly/3sx0WPu" target="_blank">short </a
        ><a href="https://bit.ly/3k5jxhI" target="_blank">fiction </a
        ><a href="https://bit.ly/3mfgSVb" target="_blank">anthologies</a>
        allowing story writers to reflect on social conditions and the world
        around them in real time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I focus specifically on short fiction published in the last ten years –
        including collections by Lucy Sweeney Byrne, Claire Keegan, Nicole
        Flattery, Danielle McLaughlin, Claire Louise Bennett, Cathy Sweeney,
        Mary Costello, Wendy Erskine, Lucy Caldwell and June Caldwell, among
        others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Broadly, my work examines the ways that literature charts changes and
        transitions in the ideological underpinnings of contemporary society; my
        thesis explores literary representations of Ireland’s changing
        hegemonies, from traditionalism to modernisation and neoliberal late
        capitalism. As a researcher, I am interested in what it means to ‘write
        Ireland’ in a context defined by globalisation, neoliberalism, and a
        post-history outlook.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also hold a first-class honours degree in English Literature & History
        from Trinity College Dublin, where I was elected
        <a href="https://bit.ly/3y4Lr21" target="_blank"> Scholar </a>
        in 2016. In 2019, I was awarded an MSc. with distinction from the
        University of Edinburgh.
