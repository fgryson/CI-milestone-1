![AmIResponsive image](readme-images/amiresponsive.png)

Orlaith Darling is a doctoral candidate in Trinity College Dublin. She has been published in various journals and blogs, and also been a part of numerous academic projects.

You can see the deployed version [here](https://fgryson.github.io/CI-milestone-1/).

## 1. UX

### 1.1. Project Goals

The website was designed as a place for the academic to collect and display the various works she has online, improving her online presence and creating the opportunity for her work to be seen in context together.

From the perspective of a visitor the site acts as both a short bio on the academic and as an easy to reference collection of her work.

### 1.2. User Stories

- General User Goals:
  - As a user, I want to get a general overview of the academic's achievements.
  - As a user, I want to access the articles and blog posts of this academic.
  - As a user, I want to see what projects this academic is working on.

- Fellow Academic Goals;
  - As a fellow academic, access the subject's twitter feed to network.
  - As a fellow academic, I want to get in contact and enquire about collaboration.

### 1.3. Design

- Colour scheme
  - I used two main colours in the design, Dark Teal and a light Ivory.
- Typography
  - I opted to use Merriweather throughout with serif as a fallback as a serif font lends a more academic weight to the design.
- Imagery
  - All imagery in the site is used to highlight the subjects of study the academic is involved in.

### 1.4. Wireframes

Wireframes were made using Balsamiq.

You can see them [here](readme-images/wireframes/).
