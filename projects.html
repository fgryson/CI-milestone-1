          <h3>School of English Staff-Postgraduate Seminar Series</h3>
          <p>
            I am co-convenor of Trinity College Dublin’s Staff-Postgraduate
            Seminar Series for 2020/21. The aim of the seminar series is to
            provide a relaxed and convivial atmosphere for staff and students to
            present their research to their peers. The series also welcomes
            distinguished guest lecturers from the academic community outside
            Trinity College to present on their work. We have collaborated with
            Trinity Long Room Hub to host the series online, and you can listen
            back to recordings
